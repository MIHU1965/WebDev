The WordPress API stands for the WordPress Application Programming Interface. It can be separated into multiple API sections / topics. Each covers the functions involved in and use of a given set of functionality. Together they form what might be called the WordPress API, which is the plugin/theme/add-on interface created by the entire WordPress project.
